tweeter
=======

A simple AppleScript to tweet the music you are listening to.

Just, download and run.

For best use, set a trigger on QuickSilver to run it at a keystroke. 

If you want to fully automate the tweeting process and have the script tweet on its own, uncomment the third line from the end (keystroke "D" using {command down, shift down})
